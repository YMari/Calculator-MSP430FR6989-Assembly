### Worked while taking CIIC4082 (Computer Architecture 2) course at UPRM, Spring 2021.

The goal of this project was to make a calculator application in Assembly for the Texas Instruments MSP430-FR6989 LaunchPad. The application takes in an initial number of up to 3 digits, then prompts the user for an operator, then prompts the user for the next 3 digit number, and finally returns the resulting value. Methods for the application are all commented (in Spanish) in the source code.
